                    The under representation of women in various facets of the society has been a constant point of concern for many.
                    Women not getting equal opportunities in society is a blatant violation of their rights as a human being and so
                    it is important to uncover just to what extent this problem persists in the modern-day world. In order to attain an
                    estimate of how well or poorly the women are placed in the society, as compared to their opposite gender, some key
                    indicators that may be selected to highlight the gender tilt could be looking at how many women are <strong>employed in
                    various sectors</strong> such as agricultural sector, industrial sector and service sector as opposed to their opposite gender. Another key
                    indicator could be looking at the <strong>income gap</strong> between the two genders and ultimately, looking at how strongly are
                    <strong>women represented in various decision-making bodies</strong> across the globe could add some finer detail as well.

                    This project is an attempt to simply some of these highly concerning statistics and inform the viewers about the seriousness of the situation.
                    In the following tabs to come, we shall discuss the gender tilt in the society by answering the three questions identified which were the key indicators of this imbalance.
                    We shall also be able to interact with the charts and drill down into how each region and country is doing on each of these parameters. <strong>Are you sitting down for this?</strong>

                    The <strong>Industrial sector</strong> consists of jobs which require skilled labour, such as welding, construction, jobs in a factory etc.

                    From the above plot, it is easy to see how the countries that are more dependent on agriculture (countries in Southern and Central Asia) tend to have a higher percentage of their female population employed in the agricultural sector as compared to their opposite gender, but with exception to this, all other regions see a higher involvement by men in the agricultural sector.
                </div>
                <div class="description">
                    The service sector plots show how most progressive countries, i.e. excluding countries that still are a patriarchal society (countries in Southern Asia), all other countries see a higher involvement from their female population in the service sector than the male population.
                </div>
                <div class="description">
                    The industrial sector plots consistently show a higher involvelemt from the male population of the countries than the female population most likely attributable to the false idea of women being weaker than men and being incompetent. This plot highlights a very concerning issue of how women are not afforded equal opportunities as men in the society.

                    From the above plot, it is easy to see how the gap in the income of the two genders is consistent across the globe and across all types of jobs. The plot highlights the issue of how women are not paid the same amount of money as men in the society for the same job. It has always been a pressing issue which is still very much at our hands since all of the statistics reveal how the women are treated unfairly everywhere in the world.

                <div class="description">
                    From the above plot, it is easy to see how in most of the countries around the world, women are represented by merely 25% or less in the decision making bodies which leads to them having little say in the schemes that the goverenment rolls out to its citizens. Lesser decision making representation also leads to lesser pressure over some of the major concerns regarding women inequality around the world, leaving it a completely helpless cause to try and bring along an era of equality amongst men and women.

                    Looking at all of these plots and the insights, it is pretty evident how the world is off balance when it comes to
                    affording equal opportunities to both the genders. Women are globally not participating nearly as much in
                    employment in the skilled sector as men are, have a higher income gap year on year and are not well represented
                    enough to assert power and make the necessary changes. A lot of initiatives have been taken in this regard such
                    as gender diverse hiring by corporate firms, but it is still a hurdle that we as a species need to leap over and
                    establish a balance in the world.

                    These plots also highlight how various regions perform on various parameters and allow an insight into the
                    culture and the traditions of the regions which may be leading to such an imbalance in the society. These help us
                    plan more meticulously when trying to tackle such a problem since we gain access to more personalized
                    information about the region and the countries.
